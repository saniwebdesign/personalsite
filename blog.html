<h2 style=" text-align:center;font-family: arial;">My Journey Of Creating a Personal Website
</h2>
<p1 style="font-family: arial">In this post, I would like to share how I made this website. This is my very first website. When I was creating it, I was not aware of how to build a website. So, I watched many YouTube videos and learned step by step. I made this site by coding, and I wrote the code in Notepad.<br>
<br>
I could have created a website using a drag-and-drop method, but I didn't do that because it wasn't giving me maximum satisfaction. I wanted to create a website from scratch, and I tried to do so. For this, I learned some basic HTML and CSS code. My goal was to create a very simple and clear website.<br>
<br>
Overall, I enjoyed making this site and improved my web development skills. Moving forward, I will try to add more HTML and CSS to make the site more professional.<br>
<br>
I hope you like this website. Feel free to share any feedback! </p1></div>
