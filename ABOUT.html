<div style=""><p1 style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 16px;text-align:center"> Hello, I am Sani Kumar Kunwar, a first year student at Heramba Chandra College pursuing a degree in Bcom hons. I recently joined the college and am excited about this new phase in my academic journey.</p1><br>
<br><p2 style="font-family: Arial;">I have completed my Class 10 from Sree Jagadamba Hindi High School with 65.57 percentage and my Class 12 from Tollygunge Adarsh Hindi High School with 84.4 percentage. During my studies, I developed a strong interest in accounts, which I am eager to explore further as I pursue my academic and professional goals.</p2>

<h1 style="font-family: arial;text-align: center; margin-top: 40px">Why I Chose BCOM ? </H1>
<div style=""><p1 style="text-align: center;font-family: Arial;font-size: 16px;">When I passed class 10 with 65%, I had three choices in front of me: science, arts, or commerce. I decided not to choose science because I was not very strong in that subject. I chose commerce because I wanted to become a chartered accountant.<br>
<br>
In commerce, I studied subjects like accounting, tax law, and business studies, and I began to really enjoy them. During my higher school years, I developed a love for accounts and felt eager to learn more about it. Because of this growing interest, choosing to pursue a B.Com. was a natural next step for me.<p1></div>
